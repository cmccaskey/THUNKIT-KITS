The Thunkit Electronics Christmas Ornament is a trendy PCB christmas ornament that lights up 18 cool while LEDs in a spiral pattern. This is light sensitive and only triggers in the dark in 30 second intervals. Powered by a CR2032 battery, battery life is approximately 4 months due to the heavy use of interrupts for timing.
